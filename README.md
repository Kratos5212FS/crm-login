 This is my ANGULAR Project, a bit lower quality than the rest of my projects, this was a bit hard for me but non the less, as fun to make as the others!
 First of all and most important, is NPM I to install everything needed then run NG SERVE --O in the terminal after selecting the file path.
 Project is not fully done, still needs work just like the REACT Project, this one is in lower quality but still made well enough to work as it should. Some things missing, but I will work on it again at some point. Enjoy.
